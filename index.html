        <h3>This Website is designed only for learning purpose</h3>
        <p>This my first web design. Though I don't like developing Web Applications because it's all predetermined and boring, and there is puzzles to solve and no use of Algorithms, I am still doing it because I live in Bangladesh where there most of the firms are only interested in software development and Web design</p>

        <p>My mind is a battleground, whipped and ripped asunder, torn from the very fabric of reality.My powers are driven by emotion. The more you feel, the more energy you unleash. Are you scared? You should be. Now's your chance! I'm not staying with that spooky entity... It didn't fear me at all.</p>
